# Classic Arcade game Project

This is the fourth required project on the [Udacity Front End Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

## How to play

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). Your goal is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.

At start the Player is located in the grass. There are several Enemies (bugs) which go through three different "roads" (stone boxes) at a random speed. Every time the player collides with an Enemy the game resets. Once the player reaches the water the game is finished.
